            <h1>Electromagnetic Torque Control of an Optimized Flux-Concentrated Transverse Flux Generator</h1>
            <p>This work proposes a flux concentrated transverse flux generator (FCTFG) for the guided artillery application. The effect of different manufacturing techniques like lamination stamping and solid design is studied initially. 
                The result of the solid structure is found to be better compared to the stamping. Subsequently, the leakage flux of the generator is minimized by doing a parametric simulation on four design variables. 
                The height of the rotor tooth adds reluctance to the invalid flux. Thus, participate in improving the electromagnetic torque. In addition to that, a braking circuit topology is implemented in ANSYS Simplorer to do a closed-loop torque control analysis. 
                Two MOSFETs are connected in an anti-series configuration across the braking resistor to control the electromagnetic braking torque. During rotation, the solid rotor structure develops the eddy current on the surface and reduces the control bandwidth of the FCTFG. 
                The proposed switch acts as a short-circuit and increases the braking torque band by controlling the eddy current effect on the rotor. Finally, the effect of torque control on the optimized model is tested in the virtual platform to justify its reliability.
